[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-v1.0-brightgreen)](https://github.com/tarxixs/Multi-Site-WAN-Cisco-Physical-Gear-Lab/releases)

## 🛠️ Description
This project simulates a multi-site enterprise WAN traversing a public service provider network. It is designed to mirror real-world ISP and enterprise interconnection practices. The setup includes multiple branch LANs, a simulated provider edge-core-edge MPLS backbone, and geographically separated sites interconnected over a shared infrastructure.
