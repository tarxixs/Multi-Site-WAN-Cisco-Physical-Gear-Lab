# Multi-Site-WAN | Cisco physical gear lab
This project simulates a multi-site enterprise WAN traversing a public service provider network, designed to mirror real-world ISP and enterprise interconnection practices. The topology includes multiple branch LANs, a simulated provider edge–core–edge MPLS backbone, and geographically separated sites interconnected over a shared infrastructure.
